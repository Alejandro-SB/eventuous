# Eventuous

Event Sourcing library for .NET, which is:
- Somewhat volatile as breaking changes keep coming in
- Very opinionated
- [EventStoreDB](https://eventstore.com)-oriented
- .NET-friendly (decent DI, logging, and diagnostics support)

## Documentation

Documentation is available on [eventuous.dev](https://eventuous.dev).

It might be not up to date as we are currently solidifying the codebase. 
This work leads to many breaking changes, and the documentation will get updated when the codebase stabilises.

## Packages

Stable versions and release candidates are available on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/Eventuous).

In addition, latest dev versions are available on MyGet under the public feed `https://www.myget.org/F/eventuous/api/v3/index.json`.
