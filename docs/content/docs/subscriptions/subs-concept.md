## What could possibly go wrong?

One of the common mistakes people make when building an event-sourced application is to use an event store, which is not capable of handling realtime subscriptions. It forces developers to engage some sort of message bus to deliver new events to subscribers. There are [quite a few issues]({{< ref "the-right-way" >}}) with that approach, but the most obvious one is a two-phase commit.

{{< alert icon="ðŸ‘‰" text="Read more about the <b><a href='../../prologue/the-right-way/#event-bus'>Bad Bus â†’</a></b>" >}}

When using two distinct pieces of infrastructure in one transaction, you risk one of those operations to fail. Let's use the following example code, which is very common:

```csharp
await _repository.Save(newEvents);
await _bus.Publish(newEvents);
```

If the second operation fails, the command side of the application would remain consistent. However, any read models, which projects those events, will not be updated. So, essentially, the reporting model will become inconsistent against the transactional model. The worst part is that the reporting model will never recover from the failure.

As mentioned, there are multiple issues of using a message bus as transport to deliver events to reporting models, but we won't be covering them on this page.

The easiest way to solve the issue is to use a database, which supports realtime subscriptions to event streams out of the box. That's why we use EventStoreDB as the primary event store implementation.

## Subscriptions

Most of the time, subscriptions are used for two purposes:
1. Deliver events to reporting models
1. Emit integration events

Subscriptions can subscribe from any position of a stream, but normally you'd subscribe from the beginning of the stream, which allows you to process all the historical events. For integration purposes, however, you would usually subscribe from _now_, as emitting historical events to other systems might produce undesired side effects.

In Eventuous, subscriptions are specific to event store implementation. We currently only provide subscriptions for EventStoreDB.
