Eventuous provides a single abstraction for the domain objects persistence, which is the `AggregateStore`.

The `AggregateStore` uses the `IEventStore` abstraction to be persistence-agnostic, so it can be used as-is, when you give it a proper implementation of event store.

We have only two operations in the `AggegateStore`:
- `Load` - retrieves events from an aggregate stream and restores the aggregate state using those events.
- `Store` - collects new events from an aggregate and stores those events to the aggregate stream.

Our `ApplicationService` uses the `AggregateStore` in its command-handling flow.
