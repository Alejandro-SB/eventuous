## What is Eventuous

Eventuous is a (relatively) lightweight library, which allows building production-grade applications using the [Event Sourcing](https://zimarev.com/blog/event-sourcing/introduction/) pattern.

The base library has a set of abstractions, following Domain-Driven Design tactical patterns, like `Aggregate`.

Additional components include:
- Aggregate persistence using [EventStoreDB](https://eventstore.com)
- Real-time subscriptions for EventStoreDB
- Read-model projections for MongoDB

### Warning

Eventuous is in a highly volatile state as it changes according to immediate needs of its production users. The API is not stable and can change at any time.
